### Aditional info
The data was taken from MercadoLibre.com public API using a simple python script. 
I uploaded both the script (might not be reusable in the future without modifications) 
and the sql dump in case someone needs to import a working database. 
All the images were originally links to cloud resources but I decided later to serve them as static assets for simplicity.
